-This is LattE Macchiato, a version of LattE derived from the official Release 1.2.

It requires the following programs and libraries: 

  * GMP, compiled with --enable-cxx
  * NTL, version 5.4 or newer
  * CDD+
  * cddlib
  * (optional) LRS
  * (optional) LiDIA


Building and installing LattE
-----------------------------

The following instructions assume you want to install LattE and
all its prerequisites into your home directory, namely into a
hierarchy rooted at the directory $HOME/latte.

1. Install the GNU Multiple Precision Library

   Download it from http://www.swox.com/gmp/
   Unpack it, then in the source directory do:

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --enable-cxx
   make
   make install

2. Install Victor Shoup's Number Theoretic Library

   Obtain it from http://www.shoup.net/ntl/ 
   Unpack it, then in the source directory do:
   
   cd src
   ./configure PREFIX=$HOME/latte GMP_PREFIX=$HOME/latte
   make
   make install

3. Install Komei Fukuda's packages CDD+ and cddlib

   Obtain then from http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home
   
4. Put $HOME/latte/bin into your $PATH
   and $HOME/latte/lib into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

N. Build and install LattE

   From the source directory of LattE:

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --with-default=$HOME/latte
   make
   make install

Now the LattE executables (count, ehrhart, minimize, maximize)
should be available in $HOME/latte/bin.

Changes since the official release 1.2:

 * Use GNU Autoconf and Automake.

 * Portability fixes.

 * Code clean-up.

 * Some performance improvements.

 * New exponential substitution 

        count --exp

 * New primal irrational decomposition 

        count --irr

 * New non-unimodular enumeration

        count --maxdet=N

 * New all-primal irrational decomposition 

        count --all-primal

 * New method for computing Ehrhart polynomials of integral polytopes 
   in the primal space 

        count --all-primal --ehrhart-polynomial

 * The homogenized method now allows V-representation input 

        count homog vrep

 * The functionality of `ehrhart' has been merged into `count':
 
	count --ehrhart-series FILENAME

	      (replaces: ehrhart FILENAME)

	count --simplified-ehrhart-series FILENAME

	      (replaces: ehrhart simplify FILENAME)

	count --ehrhart-taylor=N FILENAME

	      (replaces: ehrhart N FILENAME)

   (The `ehrhart' program is still available, but it does not accept
   the new command-line options of `count'.)

* The TOPCOM program by Joerg Rambau can be used instead of cddlib to
  compute triangulations of cones (but it is usually not faster).

  	./configure --with-topcom=PATH-TO-TOPCOM

  	count --triangulation=topcom

* The 4ti2 program (http://www.4ti2.de) can be used instead of cddlib and CDD+
  to compute the vertex cones of polytopes and triangulations and duals of cones.
  In many cases, 4ti2 is faster.

        ./configure --with-4ti2=PATH-TO-4ti2

	count --triangulation=4ti2 --dualization=4ti2 --compute-vertex-cones=4ti2

* New command-line option --redundancy-check={none,cddlib,full-cddlib}.
  
  - "full-cddlib" uses cddlib to compute an irredundant system of
    linear equations and inequalities describing the polyhedron.  This
    corresponds to the traditional LattE behavior; it can be expensive.

  - "cddlib" (the new default) uses cddlib to compute the implicit linearities only.

  - "none" does nothing, the input description of the polytope should
    be irredundant.

* New programs, `latte2ine' and `latte2ext', are built that perform
  the trivial conversion from LattE-style input files to CDD-style
  input files.

  	latte2ine < FILENAME.latte > FILENAME.ine
	latte2ext < FILENAME.vrep.latte > FILENAME.ext

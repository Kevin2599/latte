Code clean-up:

* Residue calculations:
   - "Re-implement" Residue (print.cpp) 
      in terms of Residue_Single_Cone (print-single.cpp).
      (and move them to a separate file, residue.cpp).
   - Likewise, consolidate ResidueFunction (RudyResNTL.cpp) and
      ResidueFunction_Single_Cone (ResSingle.cpp)
   - Factor out construction of generic vector.

* Data structures:
   - ZZ vs. Integer
     We will use Integer (typedefed to ZZ).

* Main programs:
   Factor out code.

* Remove:
   - CreateExample.cpp (or move to test-suite generators)

* Reading CDD-style input files currently segfaults
  because CheckEmpty is not prepared to deal with CDD files.
  (what is CheckEmpty good for?)

* Replace the broken CDD-style parser
  with a call to cddlib functions.

Configuration:

 Figure out how to use fast compiler switches by default.
 (-O2 for gcc, -fast for Forte)

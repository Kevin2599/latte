Algorithmic TODO:

* Implement irrational decomposition for the homogenized case.
   Currently ResidueFunction_Single_Cone and ResidueFunction assume
   unshifted cones (vertex == 0), so irrational decomposition does not
   work currently.

* Implement exponential substitution for the homogenized case.


Code clean-up:

* Residue calculations:
   - "Re-implement" Residue in terms of Residue_Single_Cone (Residue.cpp).
   - Likewise, consolidate ResidueFunction (RudyResNTL.cpp) and
      ResidueFunction_Single_Cone (ResSingle.cpp)
   - Factor out construction of generic vector.

* Main programs:
   Factor out code.

* Remove:
   - CreateExample.cpp (or move to test-suite generators)

* Reading CDD-style input files currently segfaults
  because CheckEmpty is not prepared to deal with CDD files.
  (what is CheckEmpty good for?)

* Replace the broken CDD-style parser
  with a call to cddlib functions.


Documentation:

* Describe configuration & build.


Configuration:

* Figure out how to use fast compiler switches by default, so that
   novice users do not complain about poor performance
   (-O2 for gcc, -fast for Forte)

* Make compile and run with compilers other than g++

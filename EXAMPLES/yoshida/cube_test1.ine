* Compiled for Rational Exact Arithmetic with G++
*Input File:Examples/cube_test1(8x5)
*HyperplaneOrder: LexMin
*Degeneracy preknowledge for computation: None (possible degeneracy)
*Hull computation is chosen.
*Computation starts     at Mon Feb 24 18:37:16 2003
*            terminates at Mon Feb 24 18:37:16 2003
*Total processor time = 0 seconds
*                     = 0h 0m 0s
*Since hull computation is chosen, the output is a minimal inequality system
*FINAL RESULT:
*Number of Facets = 6

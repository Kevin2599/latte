This directory contains a distribution of the Maple programs that
implement and test the algorithms presented in the paper:

  - Velleda Baldoni, Nicole Berline, Jesus A. De Loera, Matthias
    Koeppe, and Michele Vergne, Computation of the highest
    coefficients of weighted Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of rational
    polyhedra, Foundations of Computational Mathematics 12 (2012),
    435-469, doi:10.1007/s10208-011-9106-4

The authors are thankful for the help received from students
B. Dutra and G. Pinto.

This distribution of Maple programs is available here for archival
purposes.

For any production use, please use the revised Maple programs instead
that have been released as part of LattE integrale, version 1.7.

The release has 3 files:

testingTopEhrhart_lib.mpl  
testingTopEhrhart.mpl
TopEhrhart_lib.mpl

TopEhrhart_lib.mpl is the most important files containing the MAPLE
implementation of the key algorithms of the paper. The tables used
in the paper were generated with the help of testingTopEhrhart.mpl
which is mostly a collection of small reading/writing/timing routines
and testingTopEhrhart_lib.mpl contains auxiliary utilities to generate
random simplices and their equations.

This a distribution of the MAPLE programs that test the algorithms
presented in the paper ``Computation of the Highest coefficients
of Weighted Ehrhart Quasi-polynomials of rational polyhedra'' by
V. Baldoni, N. Berline, J. De Loera, M. Koeppe, and M. Vergne.
We thankful for the help we received from students B. Dutra and
G. Pinto.

The release has 3 files:

testingTopEhrhart_lib.mpl  
testingTopEhrhart.mpl
TopEhrhart_lib.mpl

TopEhrhart_lib.mpl is the most important files containing the MAPLE
implementation of the key algorithms of the paper. The tables used
in the paper were generated with the help of testingTopEhrhart.mpl
which is mostly a collection of small reading/writing/timing routines
and testingTopEhrhart_lib.mpl contains auxiliary utilities to generate
random simplices and their equations.
